[Plan](https://github.com/danja/kodaly/blob/main/plan.md) roughly figured out.

Started on training image capture code (using Python3, OpenCV & QT)

Located a promising-looking model : [MnistSimpleCNN](https://github.com/ansh941/MnistSimpleCNN) (it's the most accurate on this [list of MNIST classifiers](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mnist), seems well documented, has PyTorch code)
