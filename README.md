[Plan](https://github.com/danja/kodaly/blob/main/plan.md) roughly figured out.

Started on training image capture code (using Python3, OpenCV & QT)

Located a promising-looking model : [MnistSimpleCNN](https://github.com/ansh941/MnistSimpleCNN) (it's the most accurate on this [list of MNIST classifiers](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mnist), seems well documented, has PyTorch code)

- [The MNIST Database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- [Fashion MNIST Database](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
